### Instructions  
#### Write a blog post to respond to the prompt below:

#### You've just completed your first project for the course - hooray!  Write a blog post reflecting on your project (what was the purpose of the project, what did you learn, what you would do differently, etc.).  You should upload your final document from project 1 and link to it as well. Your blog post can be written in a conversational tone or more formally (however you want to represent yourself).  There is no word count or anything like that, just make sure you answer the prompts above to receive full credit.
   
.: *what was the purpose of the project* :.

Hooray! We finally finished our first project in the course and I didn't die too bad. 

For our first project in ST558 - Data Science for Statisticians, we are asked to work through the Project 1 instructions provided and create custom functions that will manipulate, process, and combine data sets that come in the .csv format (via a url link). From there, we will create a generic function that will automatically plot and return data based on different input choices we decide to enter into the parameters of our generic function(s). Our report is written up in an R Markdown file that will output an .html page. We also had to write a narrative in order to show that we fully understood each step carried out and assess many Learning Objectives from Topic 1 that we have learned.

In summary, I think the purpose of this project was to get us to do the following:

> - reinforce how to set up an HTML R Markdown file, YAML header, table of contents, etc. 
> - read in .csv files via URL links
> - write out syntax that we understand in a straight forward way for each step of the project, while reinforcing `tidyverse` functions and conditionals
> - wrap those steps in small custom functions
> - nest those small custom funcitons into one single funciton 
> - learn how to read and combine datasets; two at a time and apply that to many datasets (4 max)
> - learn about how to plot from the directions
> - create plotting functions that we can use for many different inputs
> - keeping in mind that we always have default values for our functions if we chose not to sepcify an input
> - show us how to create custom functions little by little
> - challenge us with an excersise that takes things we learned and apply them step by step to create a custom function 
> - small steps leading to a bigger task

 .: *what did you learn* :.
 
What I learned through this entire project is that programming is frustrating - especially if you're working on one screen. Being organized in you program is important to -- like keeping parethases in check, because it can get very confusing. I had to label my closing parenthases so that I wouldn't get lost. I copied all the directions over first and then commented as much as I could as I completed the project. This helped a lot because I didn't have to flip back and forth between applicaitons. I reinforced what functions go to which tidyverse toolkit/package because that was a bit confusing at first, but I think that comes with practice/exposue. I got to learn funcitons more carefully just by looking up how to use them and explaining with the narrative. I have some SAS knowledge, so it was interesting to see how certain things are programmed in R. I also didn't realize you could reference a variable in a dataset without merging/combining it first. It was the step where we had to pick the x amount of states from the manipulated dataset in order to pick those states in the orgional dataset and plot those observations. I also learned how to use nested ifelse() functions. That part was very tedious to me.

.: *what you would do differently, etc.* :.

Some things that I would do differntly is spend more time on my typography choices(?). I'm not sure I realy did those correctly, but I pretty much put the tick symbols around anything I thought was important coding wise. I also would have tried to write the narrative and edit my comments as I was completing the project because going back over it would have just been proof reading and checking spacing once - rather than having to go back many more times making sure I understood what I was doing again after the fact and losing my train of thought. Lastly, I always feel like I should start sooner rather than later, even though I did start pretty early on this project.

Notes from Discussion Board:

After chatting with a few people, I should give some more guidance! You can just upload your .html file into your main repo area (the part that has the _posts folder in it). From there you can take the file name (say project1.html) and append that to your github.io site. For instance, https://jbpost2.github.io/project1.html

That provides a link to the project html page!
