## STT558 - My First Blog Post

### Instructions
#### After reading the "Data Science articles," write a blog post to respond to the prompt below:

#### What do you think being a data scientist is about? What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

Statistics is a crucial component of data science, and you can't really have one without the other. I think that being data scientist is about being a hybrid of knowing how to program (computer science), but also knowing how to apply mathematical/statistical methods in order to take large scale data and give meaning to it. For example, immense product knowledge was mentioned a lot throughout these articles, and I think that just speaks to the kind of data you are working with (e.g., a weight loss app, oncology studies, a mobile game app) and the experience you gain over the years -- again, making sense of your data and your findings because you truly understand it. I don't think that data scientists are all too different from statisticians except maybe the words they use to communicate with and their level of programming knowledge (a lot of technical knowledge that is out of the scope of a typical statistics program). 

To me, data scientist is kind of ambiguous and I still don't know if I really know what the distinction is after reading these articles, but it does seem like when the definition is a bit clearer, then they will be in high demand. 
   
#### What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

As far as the differences/similarities between the two goes, please see the following:

Differences:
- Level of knowledge of statistics
> Sat need to understand the modeling and structure of data
>
> Data scientists need to understand applied statistics

- Methods for data collection
> Statisticians often rely on more traditional methods of data collecting that are smaller in scale; such as, as surveys, polls, and experiments. 
> 
> Data scientists have data that is often very large, and because of that, they spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest (reading/processing data for analysis), data cleansing and transformation.

- How a model is selected / modeling approach
> Statisticians start by using a simple model, like linear regression. If the data is consistent with the assumptions of the model, then it is a good model. The model is further improved by addressing more assumptions.
> 
> Data science problems are formulated and tested using a modeling process which focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model. Data scientists do this by comparing the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the model with the best accuracy.

- Concepts of interest
> Statisticians deal with concepts like point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals, standard errors, p-values, and hypothesis testing.
> 
> Data scientists closely follow the “data science process” -- data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling. 

- Public understanding
> Statisticians can be viewed as confusing to the general public.
> 
> Data science is more approachable - in a more digestible wrapper for understanding.

- Communication: nomenclature for describing similar principals
> Data scientists speak of things like: “example” whereas statisticians use “observation,” “feature” versus “predictor” or “independent variable,” “label” versus “response” or “dependent variable.”.

Similarities:
- Both data scientists and statisticians tend to gather information for similar purposes
- Both analyze data
- Both communicate their results to other people 
- Both can be skilled in various programming languages / do some sort of programming
- Both ask questions to find out what the primary endpoint is / what they are trying to answer
 
#### How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I view myself as neither, but if I had to choose then it would be more along the lines of statistician. I'm still a junior programmer and I don’t implement model procedures much into my programs outside of summary statistics. I'm not a data scientist because the studies I've been on do not have a massive amount of records. I think that the path I'm on is more traditionally for a statistician, but by taking this class I hope to learn more about being a data scientist. 

#### Your blog post can be written in a conversational tone or more formally (however you want to represent yourself). There is no word count or anything like that, just make sure you answer the prompts above to receive full credit. Submit the URL for your GitHub blog in the text box.
