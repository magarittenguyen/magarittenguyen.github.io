## STT558 - My First Blog Post

### Instructions
#### After reading the "Data Science articles," write a blog post to respond to the prompt below:

#### What do you think being a data scientist is about? What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

Statistics is a crucial component of data science. You can't really have one without the other. I think that being data scientist is about being a hybrid of knowing how to program (computer science), but also knowing how to apply mathematical/statistical methods in order to take large scale data and give meaning to it. For example, immense product knowldege was mentioned a lot throughout these articles and I think that just speaks to the kind of data you are working with and the expeince you gain over the years -- again, making sense of your data and your findings because you truly understand it. I don't think that data scientists are all too different from statisticians except maybe the words they use to communicate with and their level of programming knowledge (a lot of techincal knowledge that is out of the scope of a typical statistics program). 

To me, data scientist is is kind of ambigious and I still don't know if I really know what the distiction is after reading these articels, but it does seem like when the definition is a bit clearer, then they will be in high demand. 
   
#### What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

As far as the differences/similarites between the two go, please see the folowing:

differences:
- Level of knowledge of statitics
>  need to understand the modeling and structure of data
> Data scientists need to understand applied statistics

- Methods for data collection
> Statisticians often rely on more traditional methods of data collecting that are smaller in scale; such as, as surveys, polls, and experiments. 
> Data scientists have data that is often very large, and because of that, they spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest (reading/procesing data for analysis), data cleansing and transformation.

- How a model is selected / modeling approach
> Statisticians start by using a simple model, like linear regression. If the data is consistent with the assumptions of the model then it is a good model. The model is futher improved by addressing more assumptions.
> Data science problems are formulated and tested using a modeling process which focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model

- Concepts of interest
> Statisticians deal with concepts like point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals, standard errors, p-values, and hypothesis testing
> Data scientists closely follow the “data science process” -- data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling 

- Public understanding
> Statisticians can be viewed as confusing to the general public
> Data science is more approachable - in a more digetable wrapper for understanding

- Communication: nomenclature for dscribing similar principals
> Data scientists speak of things like: “example” whereas statisticians use “observation,” “feature” versus “predictor” or “independent variable,” “label” versus “response” or “dependent variable.”

similarities:
- data scientists and statisticians tend to gather information for similar purposes





 Data scientists do this by comparing the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the model with the best accuracy.
 
 
 The starting point in statistics is usually a simple model, such as linear regression, where the data is verified to determine whether it is consistent with the assumptions of the model. 
 



 

#### How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I view myself as neither, but if i had to chose then it would be more along the lines of statisticain. I'm still a junior programmer and i dont impliment models procedures much into my programs. I'm not a data scintists because the studies ive been on do not have a masive amount of records. I think that the path im on is more traditoinally for a statitician, but by taking this calss i hope to learn more.
