### Instructions  
#### Write a blog post to respond to the prompt below:

> - We're just about done with the course (woot)!  
>>  - What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?   
>>  - Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about?   

I really can't believe we are almost done!!!

.: What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course? :.

Now that we are most of the way through the course - STT558 - Data Science for Statisticians, I will be able to make nicer reports for future classes via R Markdown instead of what I used to do -- which was, just copy paste everything into a Word.docx and maybe save it as a PDF. I will also be able to navigate more easily in GitHub and link between R Studio and GitHub. In the future, I also will be able to create GitHub pages, vinettes, etc.. Some other things will be the improvements with my proficiency and Good Programming Practice (GPP) in R in how I comment throughout my program, create functions for more dynamic and efficient programming, the use of automation, how to read in data // look for APIs, the use of the tidyverse package (love the ability to manipluate the data, chaining/piping) and many other packages (e.g. ggplot2 for more sophisticated looking plots). I also understand modeling a bit better in R and how to build a Shiny App with Docker if I ever need to. This App building part is the most interesting to me!


.: Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? 

I'm not sure if I will ever transition out of clinical trials to be a data scientist (unless they start hiring data scientists or create a new department -- which makes me wonder if there will be overlap eventually in the statistical programming department), but I'm leaving my options open because who knows what will happen in the future. This course has been very useful in that I have a better understanding of R, Data Science, and Statistics as a whole and how they can be very intertwined. I know that is recent years companies that I have worked for have been asking if people have al lot of experience in R, statistical / data analysis in R, or the ability to create tables, listings, and figures in R. I want to volunteer, but I'm still learning and not quite at the level they are looking for, so I'll just stick to SAS for now (one language at a time! So I won't be a master of none lol.) Conferences I have been to have also  in the past year had topics on R and Machine Learning, so I know there will come a big shift in the industry and how they are trying to cater to Universities and other types of sponsers/clients that the didn't consider traditionally. I'm super curious how Dashboards and Shiny Apps will come into play in the future. 

As for my career as a statistical programmer, I'm just trying to graduate school (get that job security), keep reaching for and working towards the next position. Seems like I have a lot of options once I graduate. 

i. continue on the programming / technical path  
statsitical programmer III -> senior statistical programmer I -> senior statistical programmer II ->   

ii. continue on the programming / technical path OR managerial path  
principle statistical programmer I -> principle statistical programmer II   
or  
associate manager -> manager -> senior manager -> associate director (idk if ill ever make it here, but again keeping my options open!)  

or  
 
ii. shift to the biostatistics department    
biostatistician I -> biostatistician II -> senior biostatistician I -> senior biostatistician II -> principle biostatistician I -> principle biostatistician II -> statistical consultant  

I also ask my self all the time if I have what it takes to finish a PhD Program, but I always have my doubts - like if I'm smart enough, will I have time to start a family, whether or not I need it for career advancement, work-life-school balance... so many questions. Not to mention my deathly fear of speaking in front of groups of people... without shaking and crying... -_- i hate it. need to go to toast masters or something...

I have no idea where I'm headed, but taking one thing at a time!!!


.: What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about? :.

I thought about Python, because it is also creeping into the Clinical Trials world, but I'm not sure when I would. I wonder what other languages will become importatnt to know in the coming years. Also, if Shiny Apps / Dashboards will ever become a thing in Clinical Trials or how they play a part of a day to day job as a Data Scientist.
