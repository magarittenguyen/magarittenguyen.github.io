## ST558 - Project 3 
### Group 3F

#### Blog

**.: Instructions :.**

Once youâ€™ve completed the project each of you should write a brief blog post outlining your project and two links to the username.github.io/repo-name site and the repo itself (the username may correspond to your partner). You should then also reflect on the process you went through. 

Discuss the following:

- what would you do differently? 

- what was the most difficult part for you?  

- what are your big take-aways from this project?

Hooray! And another one!

**.: Overview :.**

The purpose of this project was for us to select the best predictive model from a certain subset of data from this Online News Popularity Data Set. The dataset provided a summarization of a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years. The subsets consisted of channels for the following topics: Lifestyle, Entertainment, Business, Social Media, Tech, and World. 

We were to create a summary report based on 4 different models (MLR model #1, MLR model #2, Random Forest, and Boosting) and be able to select which model had the best  ability to predict the number of shared articles for 6 different channels based on which one had the smallest RMSE value. Once, one interation of our summary report was done for one channel (we chose to start with Lifestlye), we were then asked to expand this to all the other channels / subsets via automation. Then, we would have to store this on our GitHub and create nested GitHub pages -- each page being unique to each channel. 

Before subsetting our data, we were to do some Exploritory Data Analysis (EDA) and produce summar statistics and meaningful plots for varibles we thought could be important to the prediction of shared articles.

In the end, we found that in 4/6 times, the best predictive model was a boosting model.

This project was a collaborative efforts from Group F, which consisted of me an my partner Matthew Sookoo. 

**.: Questions :.**
   
**what would you do differently?**

Some things that I would do differently:

> - Try to start earlier - there were a lot of tihngs due very close together along with studying for the exam, so we had to really crack down Friday and through the weekend to get this all done. I'm so grateful for the extra two days for the project. I honestly feel like we are more ready today then we were Monday.
> Although this time we did a better job of collaborating, I think it still was very hard to get rolling and delligate work -  I think there is a level of trusting your partner that you have to work through initially - because you are trusting them with your grade. In the end we were able to push and make meetings more regular and the comunication got more easy instead of a couple hours going by, but neither of us knowing if any progress is actually getting made - we are finally on the same page in the end. So, I guess, push harder for those meetings and screen shares to be able to deligate earlier on even thought we were in contact well in advanced. I reached out 3 weeks in advnaced but we only really met up right after the exam.
> - I was able to figure out the repo set up more easily this time because I just could ask my last partner if i ran into issues!
> - Spend more time on my typography choices(?) again. 
> - Tried to write the narrative and edit my comments as I was completing the project because going back over it would have just been proof reading and checking spacing once - still didnt do this again.
> - I always feel like I should start sooner rather than later, even though I did start pretty early on this project. (I always wish I have more time, but I think we did a good job with the time we had.)
> - make sure that one iteration works perfectly the first time so I don't have to keep rendering 6 at a time when i need to make a few small changes when I'm proof reading
> - I still feel the same as the last project? 

**what was the most difficult part for you?**

Some things that I found difficult were:

> - AUTOMATION!!!
> - Trying to grab / index things that I wanted from a multilayerd lists
> - Making my code dynamic
> - Getting familiar with GitHub again at first, like creating a new repo, linking GitHub and RStudio

***what are your big take-aways from this project?**

My big takeaways from this project are:

> - Getting more exposire to EDA, creating summary statistics, meaningful plots, and their interpretation  
> - How to compare multiple models to find the best one / create a summary report  
> - Understanding the many layers that GitHub can have / how everything fits together like a puzzle  
> - How to do automation and understand how it works  
> - Applying in line r code that resolved to a desired value via `r ` for more dynamic summaries, results, and interpretations
